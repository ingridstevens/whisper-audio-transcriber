The speaker mentions that a republic should be grounded in eternal truth and apply the self-evident propositions that all men are created equal and have inalienable rights. Additionally, the republic should provide an environment where civil and religious liberty stimulate people to work hard and the law protects citizens from harm. The speaker also emphasizes that every citizen is a sovereign, but no one desires to wear a crown. Furthermore, the republic should be a moral factor in the world's progress and an accepted arbiter of global disputes. (Bryan, 1896)\n"
